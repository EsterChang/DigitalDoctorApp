Database Tutorial
------------------

****I PUT EVERYTHING I COULD THINK OF, LET ME KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT
****THE STRUCTURE. THE INSERTION/DELETION WILL BE COVERED LATER WHEN NECESSARY


VIEWING DATABASE LOCATION
-------------------------
Inside our app, we currently have 1 Database: DigitalDoctor.db
You can find it by opening it through
	Help->Find Action
	Search Device File Explorer
	Open data->data->com.juniordesign.digitaldoctor->databases
Inside that folder, you should see DigitalDoctor.db and DigitalDoctor.db-journal


DATABASE STRUCTURE
------------------

The database has 5 tables:


body_part_specific_table

primary_area|primary_symptom|extra_info|symptom_name
-----------------------------------------------------
            |               |          |        
            |               |          |        
            |               |          |        


generalized_symptom_table

primary_symptom|extra_info|symptom_name
---------------------------------------
               |          |        
               |          |        
               |          |        


pregnancy_table

primary_symptom|extra_info|symptom_name
---------------------------------------
               |          |        
               |          |        
               |          |   


childhood_table

primary_area|extra_info|symptom_name
------------------------------------
            |          |        
            |          |        
            |          |     


diagnosis_table

symptom_name|symptom_severity|symptom_info
------------------------------------------
            |                |
            |                |
            |                |


Each table has primary keys. In essence, a primary key states there cannot be a
duplicate of it throughout the table.

The primary keys are as follows:
	body_part_table: Combination key of symptom_name and primary_symptom
	generalized_symptom_table: Combination key of symptom_name and primary_symptom
	pregnancy_table: Combination key of symptom_name and primary_symptom
	childhood_table: Combination key of symptom_name and primary_area
	diagnosis_table: symptom_name

Additionally, the memory for the database is permanent, across all loads. So,
I have put the loadData() method, which will eventually load ALL the data for the 
application to occur on the first load of the app, similar to the popups.

LOADING DATA
------------
I have a method written that takes in data from a raw text file, based on the 
table name passed in. For example, the body_part_specific_table will load in from
body_part_table_information.txt

This is loaded by creating an array of each line's values:
Head@Headache@From a fall@Head Injury
will be an array like:
["Head", "Headache", "From a fall", "Head Injury"]
which is then created as "content values" (what is put in the array)
and inserted in the order they are within the String array.
