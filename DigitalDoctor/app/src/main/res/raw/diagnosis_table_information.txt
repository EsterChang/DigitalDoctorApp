Head Injury@Caution@Before discussing the specific symptoms you should watch out for after you or someone else has experienced a head injury, you need to be aware of the following things that you should never do after a head injury: Do not move the injured person unless it’s absolutely necessary, Do not let the injured person move, get up, or walk around; wait for EMS to arrive, Do not wash a deep or heavily bleeding head wound, Do not remove any object that is sticking out of a wound, Do not shake the person if they seem dazed, Do not remove a helmet if a head injury is suspected (un- less it is necessary because they need CPR), Do not drink alcoholic beverages or take a sedative or strong pain medication for at least forty-eight hours after a head injury, Do not take aspirin after a head injury, as it can increase the risk of bleeding. Over-the-counter pain medicine such as acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol) may be used for a mild headache if you do not have liver disease or drink alcohol excessively. Now, turning to the symptoms—the following categories of symptoms are all definite warning signs that the injured person needs immediate emergency medical evaluation. Any moderate to severe bleeding from the head or face, swelling at the site of the injury, or facial bruising requires emergency treatment. Call 911 and stop the bleeding by wrapping gauze or a clean cloth snugly around the head to cover the wounded area. If blood soaks through, do not remove the cloth, but place another cloth over the first one. Since there may be a skull fracture, do not apply direct pressure to the bleeding site unless the bleeding is so severe that the person may die from blood loss. Direct pressure may damage the brain. Do not remove any debris from the wound. Apply ice packs to any swollen areas. Someone who develops symptoms such as nausea, drowsiness, slurred speech, mental confusion, or loss of consciousness even for a short period of time following a head injury needs immediate medical evaluation and close observation. Note: Any loss of consciousness after a blow to the head indicates a concussion, which is caused by the abrupt movement of the brain inside the skull. These symptoms may indicate anything from a mild injury with the temporary loss of brain function to a more serious injury with permanent brain damage. Someone who experiences prolonged unconsciousness after a head injury has sustained a more serious injury to the brain, which may include hemorrhage into the brain, blood compressing the brain, swelling of the brain, or spinal cord injury. These are real medical emergencies, and the unconscious person needs special treatment until emergency care arrives. Some tips to prevent further damage to the unconscious person are as follows: Never move the person’s head or neck! Keep their head and neck immobilized until medical personnel arrive. If the person has sustained spinal cord damage, moving the head may worsen the damage or may even be fatal. When someone is vomiting, you may need to gently turn his or her whole body to the side to stop the fluid from getting into the lungs. In this situation the head and shoulders must be moved in the same direction at the same time. This is most easily done if you get another person to assist with the head as you roll the body. This maneuver is called a “log roll.” Watch the airway of the unconscious person, because he or she may develop airway obstruction and even stop breathing. Open the mouth of the injured per- son and look for food or fluid that may be blocking the airway. This material should be removed very carefully with your fingers. If the person is still not breathing, administer CPR (see Appendix A). Unequal pupils and weakness in an arm or leg are very important observations, even if the person’s mental status has not changed. Since these symptoms may indicate complications of the head injury, they constitute a true emergency. Someone who appears to be okay shortly after a head injury may still be in danger. He or she may develop symptoms hours, days, or even months later. When this occurs, failure to obtain emergency treatment can be fatal. Be vigilant and on the alert for the person who becomes nauseated, very drowsy, and/or confused following a head injury, even if it seems that these symptoms are unrelated to the earlier injury. All of the above red light warning signals may indicate bleeding and/or swelling in the brain or around the brain, requiring emergency medical intervention. A person is at a higher risk for these types of complications (even if the head injury is relatively minor) if he or she is over the age of 65, is on blood thinners such as aspirin, plavix, and coumadin, and/or has liver disease from chronic alcohol consumption—all of which in- crease the risk of excessive bleeding. If the injured person is sent home rather than admitted to the hospital, and they go to sleep, ensure that their condition is stable by awakening them every hour for the first six hours after the injury to make certain they have not gone into an unconscious state. Then check them for consciousness every four hours for the next eighteen hours after the injury. Observe them closely for two or three days following the injury.
Blood Vessel Malformation@Caution@It is common to hear your heartbeat in your ear when you lie down and place your ear against a pillow. But if you notice the onset of pulsating noise similar to a beating heart on one side of your head, and if it is constantly present no matter how your body is positioned, it is abnormal. It could indicate a problem with your ear or a blood vessel abnormality inside your head or neck (particularly if it is in association with episodic throbbing headaches on one side of your head). The rare type of blood vessel abnormality most likely to produce this heartbeat sound is called a dural arteriovenous malformation. Under normal circumstances, veins carry blood to the heart, while arteries carry blood away from it. This abnormality, often present at birth, is caused by the direct connection of an artery to a vein, which significantly increases blood pressure in the veins. As time passes, these malformations may get larger and begin producing the heartbeat sound with such intensity that it can be heard in the ear closest to the malformation. If you experience these symptoms, seek medical evaluation by a neurologist or a neurosurgeon. A blood vessel malformation may need to be repaired so it will not rupture and cause a brain hemorrhage. A tumor is another possible cause of these symptoms. A rare cause is a partial blockage of an artery in the neck. A more common cause is rapid or turbulent blood flow in the veins around the ear.
Brain Tumor@Emergency@One of the main characteristics of a brain tumor is growth. Your headaches will worsen as the tumor grows, so if you have been having the same type of headache for more than two years, you probably do not have a malignant brain tumor. If your headache seems to be worsening over time, look for other symptoms, such as weakness, visual changes, or loss of sensation in a part of the body. It’s important to catch these symptoms quickly: Malignant brain tumors usually enlarge to a deadly size within weeks or months (though this can take as long as two years). The brain sits in a clear fluid that also surrounds the spinal nerves, which descend from the brain down the back. In a healthy person with a normal sleeping schedule (asleep at night and awake during the day), spinal fluid pressure is usually highest in the brain and spinal canal in the middle of the night. Headaches caused by a brain tumor, which increases this pressure, will usually worsen at that time. If you experience a headache that becomes progressively worse and/or seizures, or if your headaches are not responding to treatment, you need to get medical evaluation as soon as possible.
Carbon Monoxide Poisoning@Emergency@Poisoning from carbon monoxide inhalation is a leading cause of accidental death, despite public awareness of its dangers. It can occur very subtly because the gas is odorless and colorless, and there is no way of knowing that it is present until illness occurs. It does not take a lot of exposure to make you very sick; children will usually be affected first, but carbon monoxide poisoning can kill both adults and children quickly. Note: If you have pets, they will also become sick from excess exposure to the gas. The best way you can protect yourself against carbon monoxide poisoning is to be aware. Have a heat and air company test the air inside your home for carbon monoxide and test the heating system for proper exhaust once a year. Do not use kerosene heaters, charcoal grills, or camp stoves without proper ventilation, and make sure not to leave your car running in an enclosed area. If you have any of the symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning while in your car, get the exhaust system checked and make sure there are no holes in the floorboard. If you have a boat with a motor, have the engine and exhaust system checked regularly. This is important, because dangerous levels of carbon monoxide can accumulate on a boat even when it’s docked at a pier, by a stone wall, or alongside another boat. Also, make sure that no one ever swims near the boat while the motor is running. Inexpensive carbon monoxide monitors, which are sold at most hardware or department stores, will sound an alarm when levels of carbon monoxide get too high. Consider installing one on each level of your home or boat. If you suspect that you are being exposed to high levels of CO, you can have your blood tested by a doctor for the presence of carboxyhemoglobin, which can confirm a diagnosis of carbon monoxide poisoning. Note: This test may be inaccurate if you are a smoker, as levels of carboxyhemoglobin can be altered by exposure to tobacco smoke. Also, the level of carboxyhemoglobin will be lower if you have been away from the carbon monoxide for a lengthy period of time. If you develop any of the red light warning signals of carbon monoxide poisoning, get out of the enclosed area and into fresh air immediately. Go to an emergency room for evaluation and treatment.
Preeclampsia@Emergency@Preeclampsia can cause severe high blood pressure, which can in turn lead to seizures (eclampsia) and coma. This condition usually appears during the last four months of pregnancy or during the postpartum period. The exact cause of preeclampsia is unknown. It begins with changes in the body’s blood pressure control mechanisms that cause the blood vessels to constrict. The high blood pressure affects the kidneys, leading to significant weight gain and swelling. As the blood pressure rises to very high levels, you may also develop swelling in the brain and liver, leading to seizures and coma. This cascade of events is usually preventable when early treatment is instituted. The condition of preeclampsia may require delivering the baby early. If you develop the symptoms of preeclampsia, contact your doctor immediately.
Meningitis@Emergency@Meningitis is an often deadly infection of the lining of the brain, also called the meninges, and the spinal cord. While meningitis is not common, it can be contagious. Infants, young children, and the elderly are particularly susceptible. Meningitis often starts like the flu, with high fever, body aches, an oversensitivity to light, and a headache. The telltale sign of meningitis, however, is a stiff neck. If your neck is stiff or if you find that you have difficulty touching your chin to your chest, particularly if you also have a fever and a headache, seek medical evaluation. Meningitis must be diagnosed early, because it is a rapidly advancing disease. Particularly with bacterial meningitis, death can occur as early as thirty-six to forty-eight hours from the onset of symptoms, so any delay in seeking treatment can result in a fatality. Be aware that elderly patients and babies may not exhibit a stiff neck. Many elderly patients with meningitis will only have a headache and a fever. They may also seem confused and/or tired. Babies suffering from meningitis will not be able to communicate about their symptoms and may only show nonspecific signs of illness. However, young babies may have a bulge in the soft spot on their skull. Meningitis is often treatable with antibiotics. If you are exposed to someone diagnosed with meningitis, seek medical advice about preventive measures.
Temporal Arteritis@Caution@Temporal arteritis is a disease (usually occurring in senior citizens) that irritates and inflames the walls of your temporal arteries, which run along the side of your head. This disease may cause headaches and scalp pain (often noticed when combing one’s hair), tenderness around the temples, visual disturbances, and sometimes cramping of the jaw muscles while chewing. If the inflammation of the arteries becomes severe enough, blockage of the arteries (a stroke) may occur. If the artery to one of your eyes is blocked, you may also experience blurry vision or even total vision loss. A stroke can be prevented if this condition is diagnosed and treated early. A few simple blood tests, including an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and complete blood count (CBC), may help your doctor make this diagnosis. To be one hundred percent accurate, he or she may order a one- to two-inch biopsy of the temporal artery. While long-term treatment may be necessary to control the ailment, immediate treatment may prevent complications. The cause of the disease is unknown.
Bleeding in the Brain@Emergency@Most headaches are caused by factors such as stress, sinus infection, seasonal allergies, dehydration, caffeine withdrawal, eye strain, lack of sleep, low blood sugar, or migraines. These types of headaches are usually self-limited and will often go away with rest and/or over-the-counter medication. But if you ever get a sudden, severe headache that you consider the worst headache of your life or that feels different from any headache you have previously experienced, you may have a hemorrhage in your brain. In many cases this occurs after physical exertion. Again, this is a medical emergency. A subarachnoid hemorrhage is the medical term for bleeding around the brain that pools in the subarachnoid space—the space between the skull and the brain. Your skull, which is like a tight-fitting helmet that protects your brain, does not allow room for the blood that accumulates during this kind of hemorrhage. This results in increased pressure on your brain. If the subarachnoid hemorrhage is significant, the blood will continue to accumulate in the skull, which causes spasms of blood vessels, increased fluid in the brain, and increased pressure within the brain. Because the brain has the consistency of Jell-O, this can result in serious damage. Though more commonly caused by head trauma, a sub- arachnoid hemorrhage may also result from an aneurysm in the brain. Aneurysms—weakened areas on the walls of arteries—may be congenital (present at birth) or may appear later in life. Their rupture is sometimes the result of cocaine or amphetamine abuse. The symptoms of a hemorrhage in the brain include severe headache, vomiting, dizziness, seizures, black- outs, sleepiness, slurred speech, double vision, unequal pupil size, and/or mental confusion. Often only the severe headache is present, which may sometimes improve briefly, only to be followed by coma. If you experience the worst headache of your life, or a “thunderclap” headache (one that has maximal intensity at onset), call 911 or get someone to take you to an emergency room immediately. Do not take any aspirin for pain relief— since aspirin blocks the ability of the platelets to form a clot, you may end up bleeding more. If you call 911 or go to the emergency room, you need to make sure they know you are having “the worst headache of your life.” This way they will know that you need to be seen by a doctor right away. In addition, if a friend or family member complains of a new, severe headache and then becomes sleepy or difficult to awaken, it may also be a hemorrhage in the brain and a medical emergency. Early diagnosis is important because if left untreated, at least one in five people dies from this condition. Medication and/or surgery (which can include stopping the bleeding, preventing the re-bleeding, and/or decreasing the pressure within the brain by draining fluid and blood from the skull) increases the chances for survival.
Heat Exhaustion@Caution@It is hard to tell when you are in danger of heat exhaustion. When you are active on a hot day, the body uses its cooling mechanism to release sweat, because the evaporation of sweat on the body’s surface allows it to shed heat. The body is generally able to keep an even temperature this way, but environmental factors like high humidity and the absence of a breeze can make it difficult for the body to cool itself. Also, individuals with fewer sweat glands are in greater danger of heat exhaustion, as are senior citizens and young children, who have less effective cooling mechanisms. Fluid loss and a rise in body temperature can result in a serious derangement of body chemistry. Symptoms of heat exhaustion include any combination of the following: Nausea, Dizziness and/or headache, Weakness, Fatigue, Paleness, Incoordination and/or confusion, Muscle cramps, Vomiting, Low or no urine output, Pounding heartbeat, and Fainting. If you have any of the above symptoms, it is urgent that you do the following in order to avoid heatstroke: Rest, Move to the shade or indoors with air-conditioning, Sit in front of a fan, Place a wet towel over your face, arms, and legs, Spray yourself with cool water, Drink cool, nonalcoholic beverages, such as apple juice or Gatorade, to replace your electrolytes. Note: Eating a banana may help replace potassium in the body if you don’t have access to Gatorade, and Seek medical assistance, especially if your symptoms include a feeling of confusion. Call 911 or get somebody to take you to the ER immediately. You may need to be given intravenous fluids or other therapy in order to cool down quickly. The most effective method of handling heat exhaustion is to prevent it. Take frequent breaks from exercise and exposure to heat. If you get tired, rest and cool off for a while.
Orthostatic Hypotension@Caution@A constant and uninterrupted flow of blood is required by all of your body’s organs. The brain is the first organ to fail without nutrition and oxygen from the blood, so even a slight change in blood flow to the brain will produce symptoms such as dizziness or fainting. When you sit up from lying down or when you stand from a sitting position, your blood vessels and heart automatically adjust by narrowing the vessels below the heart and widening the vessels above the heart that supply the brain, assuring that there will be adequate blood pressure and blood flow to the brain. If there is not enough blood or fluid in your circulation because of bleeding or dehydration, these automatic adjustments will not provide adequate blood pressure and blood flow to the brain, and you will feel dizzy or faint. It is important to know, however, that there are a number of other potential causes for these symptoms—some as serious as heart irregularities, and others as innocuous as eating a large meal or using the bathroom (these latter examples are more common with frail older adults). Another important potential cause is medication—some medications, including water pills (diuretics), certain blood pressure pills, some drugs for psychiatric disorders, and medications for shrinking an enlarged prostate gland, can affect the blood vessels and heart such that they will not adjust properly to provide adequate blood pressure and blood flow to the brain. If you are experiencing this type of dizziness, and are on medication, talk to your doctor and make sure that your symptoms are not a side effect. If they are, your doctor may adjust or change your medication. Seek immediate medical evaluation when you begin to get dizzy or faint. If internal hemorrhage, dehydration, or heart irregularities are causing your symptoms, emergency therapy could save your life. If the cause is less serious, and it relates to diet, eating small meals more frequently may help. Regardless, it is important to resolve this situation; dizziness is particularly dangerous in senior citizens, who are more subject to serious injuries when they fall.
Hypoglycemia@Caution@Hypoglycemia means you have a low blood sugar level, numerically, in the forties or lower. At these levels you will often be- come weak, jitter, shake, sweat profusely, develop a rapid heart rate, sometimes act “weird” (this behavior is occasionally misdiagnosed as a manic episode of mental illness or as intoxication), become dizzy or faint, and/or have seizures followed by unconsciousness. The symptoms of hypoglycemia usually occur first thing in the morning or anytime when several hours have elapsed since your last meal. If left untreated, it can be fatal. Keep in mind that diabetes medication can actually drive the blood sugar so low that it causes these problems. Hypoglycemia usually occurs when diabetics take too much insulin or too many oral agents for their diabetes, or when they do not consume adequate amounts of appropriate foods. Fluctuations in blood sugar levels in diabetics can cause blurred vision due to high amounts of sugar pulling water from the lenses of the eyes. The hypoglycemic symptom of shakiness between meals (called reactive hypoglycemia) is also common in non-diabetics, particularly after consuming sugar-rich meals. Though hypoglycemia is more serious in diabetics, its symptoms can generally be improved in both of these cases by eating small, high protein, low carbohydrate meals more frequently. A rare cause of very low sugar levels in non-diabetics is a small hormone-producing tumor (insulinoma) in the pancreas, which overproduces insulin. Excess insulin then passes into the bloodstream, causing hypoglycemia. Most of these tumors are noncancerous and a complete cure can often be obtained by removing the tumor. If you are on beta-blockers, the medications used to treat hypertension and glaucoma, keep in mind that they will occasionally blunt the warning signs that your sugars are getting too low. Some of the common beta-blockers are metoprolol, carvedilol, propranolol, atenolol, and timolol. If you are taking one of these medications, the only symptom of hypoglycemia you may experience is confusion or weakness. Note: Hypoglycemia is different from hyperglycemia, which refers to high blood sugar as opposed to low blood sugar. However, some of the symptoms are similar. The doctor can distinguish between the two by simply testing the blood for sugar levels. The typical symptoms of hyperglycemia are nausea and vomiting, increased thirst and urination, decreased appetite, and fatigue. It often occurs when a diabetic inappropriately stops their diet, medication, or exercise regimen. Both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia can ultimately be life-threatening if left untreated.
Light-headedness@Not an Emergency@Dizziness may take the form of light-headedness, or it may make you feel like you are spinning on a carousel (vertigo). The balance system consists of multiple factors: To feel balanced, your inner-ear apparatus and cerebellum (the small area of the brain in the back of the skull responsible for coordination) need to be normally functioning. A breakdown in any of these systems can make you feel dizzy, particularly when you change your body position. Inner-ear disease can be sporadic, with a sudden and quite severe onset. It may cause vertigo, accompanied by nausea and vomiting. A strained neck may also sometimes cause vertigo. If you are experiencing vertigo, you are at a higher risk for falls. Falls can lead to serious injuries, such as hip fractures, and if the attack occurs when you are driving, you could have a serious auto accident. Do not drive, and avoid climbing stairs alone until your problem has been stabilized by medical treatment. If you experience vertigo (with or without nausea and vomiting), you need medical evaluation as soon as possible.
Stroke@Emergency@A stroke may be caused by a blood clot that has formed in one of the arteries that supplies the brain with oxygen. It can also be caused by a blood clot that has formed in a vessel somewhere else in the body, including the heart, and has traveled through the blood to a vessel in the brain. The area supplied by the blocked blood vessel will be rapidly damaged. The loss of oxygen affects the brain before any other body organ, and a few minutes of oxygen deprivation can result in the permanent loss of function. The symptoms of a stroke depend on which particular area of the brain is involved. If a large vessel is blocked, such as the middle cerebral artery, a large area of the brain will be affected, causing paralysis of one side of the body as well as the loss of other functions such as understanding and speaking. If a smaller blood vessel is blocked, paralysis may be limited to one arm or leg. The right side of the body is controlled by the left side of the brain, and vice versa. The left side of the brain is typically dominant for comprehension and verbalization. If you have a large stroke on the left side of your brain, it may make you unable to comprehend or to speak (for example, you know what you want to say but are unable to express your thoughts in words) and it will paralyze the right side of your body. If the stroke is on the other side, you will be paralyzed on the left side of your body and it will usually not affect your ability to comprehend or speak. A stroke can also result from the rupture of a blood vessel in the brain, which subsequently can hemorrhage. Cigarette smoking, uncontrolled high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and uncontrolled diabetes all increase your risk of having a stroke. A stroke treatment that immediately dissolves blood clots in the brain is available at many emergency centers. If instituted soon enough, this treatment can potentially stop a stroke before permanent brain injury has occurred. At present, the commonly available clot-buster therapy needs to be given within three hours of the onset of symptoms in order for it to work, though newer medications that are being developed may work for longer after symptoms first appear. Also, at some hospitals, a catheter can sometimes be put into a clogged artery to mechanically destroy the clot or to inject medicine near the clot, thus dissolving it. There are reports that the symptoms of a stroke have been reversed six hours from onset with this specific type of treatment. This therapy is not appropriate for all stroke victims. For example, if the stroke is the result of a hemorrhage in the brain, clot-buster therapy or a blood thinner could actually worsen your condition. Call an ambulance and get immediate transportation to an appropriate emergency room where clot-busting therapy is available. Hospitals will often make known that they are certified stroke centers. All stroke victims need urgent evaluation even if they are not able to get to medical care in the first three hours. Do not wait! Time is of the essence to save your brain.
Transient Ischemic Attack@Emergency@A TIA is an important red light warning signal of a stroke. When a loose blood clot in the circulation gets stuck in a narrow blood vessel traveling to the brain, it will restrict blood flow and cause abnormal functioning in the area of the brain that is not getting enough oxygen and nourishment. For example, it could create numbness of the face, slurred speech, or weakness in an arm, hand, and/or leg. If the blood clot dissolves quickly enough on its own, blood flow will return and the symptoms will subside. Note: Rhythm abnormalities of the heart can also cause decreased blood flow to the brain, resulting in these symptoms. Persons with these red light warning signals require emergency evaluation and therapy because if the next clot is larger or the heart rhythm abnormality lasts too long, the affected brain tissue may be further damaged and a stroke may occur. Also, once a TIA has occurred it is more likely to recur unless treatment is instituted. If TIA symptoms develop, do not wait to see if they resolve. Seek immediate emergency care. Note: You might not be able to tell you are having a TIA (just as epileptics have no recollection of a seizure). It may be that only the person observing you can tell you are having a problem.
Painless Heart Attack@Emergency@A heart attack can occur without chest pain, pressure in the chest, or a feeling of indigestion. A painless heart attack can be just as deadly, but much more difficult to diagnose. If you experience the above symptoms, you may be having a heart attack, especially if you have other cardiovascular risk factors, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, obesity, a smoking habit, or a family history of early death from a heart attack. Heart attacks without chest discomfort are more often seen among diabetics, women, and senior citizens. Whether or not you exhibit the classical symptoms of a heart attack, a doctor can usually make the correct diagnosis with an EKG and “dye” (intravenous contrast) studies, examining the small blood vessels that nourish your heart. Blood tests for chemical changes in the heart muscle, special types of X-rays, and scans of the heart are also helpful. Early diagnosis of a heart attack is crucial since it’s possible that life-threatening complications can be treated. In certain instances immediate therapy can prevent permanent heart damage.
Brain Injury@Emergency@If you observe someone acting combative or abusive after a head injury, get that person to a doctor as soon as possible, because he or she may have a significant brain injury. A helper who does not realize that this behavior is due to brain injury may think the person is drunk, taking illegal drugs, or just rude. It is very important that combative behavior be recognized as a possible red light warning signal, as it may be the only indicator of brain damage that is getting worse.
Depression@Emergency@From the medical perspective, the term “depression” does not necessarily mean feeling “down and withdrawn.” Its symptoms may include fatigue, loss of appetite, sleeplessness, and/or headaches. You may experience anxiety or a loss of interest in the things you normally enjoy. If you are elderly, your number- one symptom of depression might be a feeling that you are losing your memory. These feelings do not mean that you are crazy or a weak person. They may merely indicate that you have a chemical imbalance in your brain, or other biological factors such as a genetic predisposition for depression. They could also be related to environmental factors (poverty, stressful upbringing, etc.) or behavior patterns such as drug use or excessive drinking of alcoholic beverages. Certain areas of your brain have automatic centers that function without conscious thought to control the activities in your body, including your heart rate, changes in the size of your pupils or blood vessels, breathing, and sleeping. Normally when you experience an emotional event, these automatic centers create a specific spectrum of symptoms. For example, if someone frightens you, you may feel tightness in your throat, your muscles may become tense, and your heart rate may speed up. Other emotional challenges, like stress, may trigger one of your automatic brain centers such that you hyperventilate (rapid, deep breathing), have trouble sleeping, or experience headaches and an irritable stomach, all of which your brain will interpret as severe anxiety. These may some- times be severe enough to be called “panic attacks.” If you have a chemical imbalance in one of the automatic centers in your brain, you may experience a variety of these symptoms without any emotional experiences to trigger them. For example, you may feel fatigued, as though you have been exhausted all day, even though you got enough sleep the night before. You may also feel anxious, with all of the organs of your body reflecting this anxiety, even though nothing has happened to make you anxious. Or you may feel depressed and withdrawn, without there being any reason for your anxiety. Note: A chemical imbalance can also result in bipolar disorder, wherein manic behavior cycles with depressed behavior. Many effective medications can help restore the chemical balance in your brain, alleviating these symptoms. Unfortunately, many people who are suffering from chemical imbalances do not seek medical treatment. If you or a loved one have any of the symptoms of depression and have difficulty controlling them, make sure to seek help as soon as possible, because, in its most extreme form, this condition could turn suicidal. As such, it’s important to watch out for the risk factors for suicide, which are listed here: Being male (although more girls attempt suicide, more boys actually succeed), Chronic illness, Family history of suicide, Rural residence, White or Native American ethnicity, Advanced age, Alcohol or drug abuse, A gun in the house (firearms are the most common instruments of suicide in the United States), A previous suicide attempt, A traumatic experience: a death, a divorce, a failed exam, rejection by friends, etc. If you are having suicidal thoughts, there are several national phone numbers you can call to speak to someone immediately, including 1-800-273-TALK and 1-800-SUICIDE.
Overactive Thyroid Gland@Emergency@The red light warning signals of an overactive thyroid are: intolerance to heat, a rapid and irregular pulse, tremors, fatigue, profuse sweating, in- creased appetite, a feeling of anxiety, and/or bulging eyes. The thyroid gland is located in the center of the base of the neck. It serves as the body’s thermostat, regulating the metabolic functions—that is to say, how quickly or slowly you burn up calories. An overactive thyroid promotes a rapid metabolic rate. The size of your thyroid gland has nothing to do with whether it is overactive or not. If the gland has not changed in size but is functioning abnormally, you may not know to seek treatment since the symptoms may have developed gradually An overactive thyroid gland, producing excess thyroid hormone, causes the symptoms listed above, and may even cause heart failure. It is frequently associated with fatigue and double vision and can cause dangerous heart rhythm abnormalities. These and many other complications are a good reason to seek medical care as soon as possible when the symptoms creep up on you.
Delirium@Emergency@Delirium is usually manifested by an altered state of consciousness consisting of confusion, distractibility, disorientation, and disordered thinking and memory. It often develops over short periods of time (within hours or days), as opposed to Alzheimer’s dementia, which may take several years to be recognized. It will generally fluctuate from hour to hour. The person may merely seem detached from their surroundings or they may begin to tremble and become agitated, or even have hallucinations and a complete loss of contact with reality. Many ailments can affect the brain, thereby causing delirium. They include the following: Infections (most commonly pneumonia, urinary tract infections, or infections of the brain), Side effects of medication, Abnormal chemical levels in the blood, Low oxygen levels, Low blood pressure, Poisoning, Blockage of blood vessels going to the brain, and Swelling of the brain from high blood pressure. When in a state of delirium, a person usually cannot reason, and therefore getting him or her to medical care may be difficult. He or she may be uncooperative and even combative. But this situation is urgent and requires immediate medical attention. Call for emergency assistance.
Depression after a Heart Attack@Emergency@It has been clearly established from multiple scientific studies that patients’ outcomes following a heart attack can be adversely affected by depression. There are changes in the body’s chemistry when depression occurs that can affect the automatic control mechanisms of the body’s vital organs. No one has determined how these changes reduce survival rates or increase the likelihood of heart attack complications, but there is overwhelming evidence that they do. Depressed heart attack patients are more likely to have a subsequent, fatal heart attack. It is important for you to remember that there is no way to diagnose depression unless you discuss the condition with your doctor. Remember also that there are effective treatments for depression that may improve your odds of recovery. Patients often think they feel down because they have just had a heart attack. They do not realize that the depression it- self could possibly increase their risk of dying from another heart attack. So when you’re feeling down after having a heart attack, talk it over with your doctor. It might save your life.
Underactive Thyroid Gland@Emergency@The red light warning signals of an underactive thyroid are: cold intolerance, feeling cold all of the time, loss of memory, generalized body swelling (especially of the face), irregular and slow pulse, and/or a high cholesterol level. The thyroid gland is located in the center of the base of the neck. It serves as the body’s thermostat, regulating the metabolic functions—that is to say, how quickly or slowly you burn up calories. An underactive thyroid gland slows down your metabolic rate. The size of your thyroid gland has nothing to do with whether it is underactive or not. If the gland has not changed in size but is functioning abnormally, you may not know to seek treatment since the symptoms may have developed gradually. An underactive thyroid produces an insufficient amount of thyroid hormone. Besides the general symptoms listed above, you may experience marked weakness, confusion, and/or paleness or a yellowish appearance. It is also frequently associated with fatigue and double vision and can result in a high cholesterol level. These and many other complications are a good reason to seek medical care as soon as possible when the symptoms creep up on you.
Sudden Personality Change@Caution@A sudden change in personality—including anxiety, apathy, confusion, bizarre or paranoid thoughts, excessive energy (mania), and irritability—may be one of the body’s red light warning signals of a treatable chemical or physical abnormality in the body, including the brain. It is important to seek medical evaluation in order to treat the underlying illness. In many cases, medical treatment can reverse the personality disorder.
Dementia@Caution@As they age, senior citizens may eventually develop abnormal personality changes, lose their recent memories, and/or become demented. There is a cause of these mental changes, called normal pressure hydrocephalus, which can sometimes be cured. Typically, a person with this disorder has difficulty walking. Their leg muscles work fine, but their brain does not remember how to use them—the result being that the person has lost the ability to purposefully initiate specific movements. In other words, they may not be able to coordinate well enough to walk. When they do walk, the pattern will seem quite erratic and awkward, and they will frequently fall. This condition is often accompanied by an inability to control the bladder. The brain sits in a clear liquid that flows into the inner chambers of the brain. If something blocks the natural flow of this liquid, too much fluid may accumulate in these chambers. The pressure from the excess fluid damages areas of the brain, causing the symptoms described above. Possible causes for this excess fluid are a head injury, brain hemorrhage, or meningitis (an infection in the sac that surrounds the brain). It can also occur without any known cause. It usually appears in senior citizens, but can occasionally occur in younger people. A diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus can be made with special studies of the brain, including a CT scan or an MRI. If the liquid-filled chambers of the brain are enlarged, normal pressure hydrocephalus may be present. Spinal taps are also used when making a diagnosis. Fluid is drained to decrease brain pressure, followed by a reexamination to look for an improvement of symptoms. The condition can sometimes be reversed with surgery, wherein one end of a small tube is inserted in an inner chamber of the brain, and is then sewn in place down the neck through the body to the belly cavity, where the excess fluid can flow. Family members of demented senior citizens should discuss with a brain specialist (neurologist) the possibility of a diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus and the pros and cons of medical testing for it. This discussion should also include evaluation of other potentially reversible causes of senility, including decreased thyroid function (hypothyroidism), increased parathyroid function (hyperparathyroidism), vitamin B12 deficiency, the side effects of medication, alcohol damage, or the effects of a blood clot on the brain (subdural hematoma). Note: While many different conditions can cause a gradual onset of senility, any sudden change in memory, perception, or behavior in an elderly person could be a medical emergency such as a stroke, and requires prompt medical attention.
Hyperparathyroidism@Caution@The parathyroid glands (there are usually four) are located in the front base of the neck, near the thyroid gland. These small glands produce a hormone that controls the amount of calcium in your blood. If one of the glands develops a growth, or gets larger than normal, the hormonal output is increased, causing the amount of calcium (stored primarily in the bones) to increase in the bloodstream. A high level of calcium in the blood increases the risk of developing the above symptoms and ailments. In addition to these, it can cause a loss of calcium from the bones that will result in softening of the bones, and thus bone pain. The life-threatening consequences of high calcium include abnormal heart rhythms and severe dehydration. Tumors or growths of the parathyroid glands are rarely large enough to be felt by examining the neck, so you have to rely on appropriate blood studies to provide evidence that they are present. Surgical removal of a diseased parathyroid gland is usually curative. Preservation of the remaining glands is important since without them and the hormone they produce, the blood calcium level would drop too low, causing seizures and muscle spasms. This condition could even be life-threatening. The symptoms of an overactive parathyroid gland can be subtle and slowly creep up on you. If you notice these symptoms, notify your doctor for an evaluation as soon as possible.
Growths in the Intestines@Caution@In the unusual, inherited condition called Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, freckles occur on the lips and on the inside of the mouth. They may be present at birth, develop over time, or even disappear over time. It is important to determine whether they are associated with dangerous polyps (growths) in the intestines. If you have freckles that follow this pattern, an evaluation by a doctor may be appropriate to find and remove any polyps. This may help you to avoid intestinal bleeding and to prevent cancerous growths. Sometimes the polyps may already be malignant, in which case early surgical removal can be curative. Let your doctor know if you have this warning signal, especially if you have a family member who has had cancer of the colon.
Skin Cancer@Caution@If you have spent lots of time in the sun, and have developed a round, pearly bump on your face, you may have a skin cancer known as basal cell carcinoma. The face, like other areas of the skin exposed to sunlight, is a common site for this type of tumor. Basal cell cancers are usually slow-growing and do not spread, but there are exceptions. Basal cell carcinomas are most often diagnosed in people forty years of age and older. However, they can also be found in people as young as in their twenties. Albinos are particularly at risk of getting this skin condition. A diagnosis is made when your doctor cuts off a slice of the bump and inspects it under a microscope. Surgical removal can usually cure this condition. If you suspect you may have skin cancer, do not wait. See your physician early.
Fatal Reaction@Emergency@This condition is called Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and it can cause a severe allergic reaction that may damage a large area of the skin, causing it to blister and slough off. When this condition develops, seizures, coma, and death can follow, so early diagnosis and treatment are essential. If you develop a rash after starting a medication, get in touch with a doctor (preferably your own physician) immediately.
Severe Allergic Reaction@Emergency@Allergic reactions are common. They can follow exposure to just about anything, but they usually occur from foods, certain plants, bee stings, or medicines. They are not dose-related— you can have a serious reaction following even a tiny exposure. And you can also develop allergic reactions to things you were not allergic to in the past. Most allergic reactions result only in an itchy rash and swelling. Occasionally the swelling will become severe when it occurs in locations where there is loose skin, like the area around your eyes or groin. This massive swelling looks bad but is generally not dangerous; it responds well to medical treatment. Sometimes, however, allergic reactions occur very rapidly and become life-threatening. The main cause of death in these cases is an inability to breathe, because severe swelling has blocked the airways. In addition, there is a collapse in blood pressure from the sudden dilation (expansion) of blood vessels throughout the body. If you exhibit the following symptoms within thirty minutes of exposure to an allergen, then you are in danger of a full-blown allergic reaction and need to get to an emergency room immediately, or need to receive an epinephrine shot on the spot: Swelling of the tongue and mouth, Hoarseness, a “lump in the throat” feeling, difficulty swallowing, Breathing problems, a cough, chest tightness, wheezing, and croup, Dizziness, with a cold sweat and/or profuse sweating, A pale or blue appearance, Abdominal cramps and/or vomiting, and/or A loss of consciousness. Be prepared! If you have had a severe allergic reaction in the past, it may be worse next time. Know the early symptoms of a severe allergy attack so that you can tell if you need immediate life-saving medical treatment. Also, ask your doctor for a home epinephrine kit—it contains a single shot of the drug epinephrine, which you can inject into your muscle. This medicine opens your airways and tightens your blood vessels, thus saving your life. However, the effects of the shot wear off within a few hours, and you will need to be admitted to an emergency room for observation and/or further treatment. To prevent allergic reactions, you need to first become familiar with your allergies. Make a record of all allergic reactions you have experienced and what caused them. The following are some of the most common substances to which people are allergic (called allergens): Foods: shellfish, soybeans, nuts, milk, eggs, MSG, sulfites; Insect bites: bees, wasps, ants; Drugs: penicillin (most common), aspirin, sulfa-based drugs, ibuprofen or other non-aspirin pain medicine; Radiographic contrast material: the fluid injected into you during a study such as a CT scan (a special computerized X-ray), an IVP (a special X-ray of your kidneys), angiography (special X-ray study of your arteries), etc. An allergist is a medical specialist who can help you identify your specific allergies and teach you how you can avoid exposure to them. (In some cases he or she may recommend that you begin getting weekly allergy shots that will help immunize you to your allergies.) Inform any doctors and medical staff involved in your care of all of your allergies, especially if you are allergic to any medications or to the contrast material injected into you during X-ray procedures. Consider purchasing an engraved bracelet listing your allergens; your pharmacist should know where you can obtain one. This may be useful in emergency situations. There is a rare but potentially fatal ailment called angioedema that presents itself similarly to an allergic reaction. The red light warning signal of this condition is the isolated and painless swelling of a random body part—the tongue, the mouth, a hand or a foot, et cetera—without itching. People who have angioedema can spontaneously develop swelling in the windpipe, cutting off their air supply. These swellings are rare and often occur for no known reason, though they have been occasionally associated with high blood pressure and heart medications known as ACE inhibitors (check with your pharmacist or doctor to determine if any of the medications you are taking fall into this category). Urgent evaluation and treatment of this type of swelling is necessary.
Myasthenia Gravis@Emergency@Do people ask, “Why don’t you open your eyes all the way?You look like you’re sleepy”? Does your jaw get so tired at times when you are eating that you can’t take another bite? If you have droopy eyelids, a weary jaw, difficulty swallowing, and/or general weakness, especially as the day progresses, you may have a potentially serious nerve disorder called myasthenia gravis. With myasthenia gravis there is a blockage of the chemical that is needed for sending messages through your nerves to certain muscles in your body, and only a weakened nerve signal gets through. Weakened muscles make it hard to chew and cause your eyelids to droop. Other muscles, including breathing muscles, may also become weak. The weakness usually worsens with prolonged use of the muscle groups in question, and is often referred to as “fatigable weakness.” If this ailment is left untreated, it could be fatal since you could stop breathing. Effective medications can control myasthenia gravis, so if you experience these red light warning signals, see your doctor as soon as possible.
